Group Meeting
=============

For details about the group's schedule, please contact Professor Zhang to be added to the lab’s Google Calendar.

Progress Update / Journal Club
--------------------------------

**Every Monday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM (Hong Kong time)**, we alternate between a Progress Update and a Journal Club. Join via `Microsoft Teams Link <teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YWQ1OWNhYzAtODk0YS00MTU4LTgyZDUtYjgyZGExYThlMjI4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b"Tid"%3a"a2c8f93f-126b-4596-a360-8941a8984b08"%2c"Oid"%3a"a01f610e-456a-478e-a980-248fa8edd125"%7d>`_.

- During the **Progress Update**, please share your project progress from the past two weeks — Professor Zhang will join us for helpful discussions.

- During the **Journal Club**, one group member will give a literature presentation. After that, some technical issues will also be discussed.

For Progress Update, ppt slides are not mandatory, but it is essential to clearly present the work content and the subsequent plan.

For Journal Club, please prepare ppt slides on the paper using :download:`CUHK PPT template <_static/CUHK60_PPT_Template_16-9.pptx>`, this ppt slides should be understandable by others too and may be uploaded to group site. If the paper touches on additional/related concepts, methods, it will be good to include a brief discussion of those too. Visit `our group website <https://xinglong-zhang.github.io/resources.html>`_ to **access all Journal Club ppt slides!**
